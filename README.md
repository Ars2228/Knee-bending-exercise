I recently tackled an intern task to develop an algorithm for knee bend exercise detection using keypoints, angle calculations, and rep counting. I utilized a combination of my own knowledge and various resources such as Google searches and Github repositories to complete the task. However, I found that the basic implementation was lacking important logic and has room for improvement with more advanced logic and additional parameters to provide more accurate results. #kneebendexercise #algorithmdevelopment #posetracking #ai #jobs #future #chatgpt #artificialintelligence #technology #machinelearning #selflearning
